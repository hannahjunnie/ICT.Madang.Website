				<p>Madang is a legendary name given to one of the most beautiful places you could ever find in the Country of Papua New Guinea. The name of Madang was used by the Papuan Natives who had accompanied the German administrators after their home island and only became the official name of the settlement towards the end of the German administrations. As the generations are increasing, they came up with a definition of the initials for MADANG, which is defined as "Memories And Dreams Are Never Gone".</p>
				<p>From the South Coast of Madang, you could feel the cool breeze blowing from the mountains down to the valley, into the tremendous rainforest of Wali village. You could hear the beautiful voices of the birds dancing and singing like Rihanna in the deep forest up along the wonderful Panim waterfall wetlands to the biggest Gum river that is the source of water supply in Madang Town. As you go up the forest or down the waterfall, you will see the kunai grass and the beautiful nature of Kamba Kauris, Braim, Oppi, and all the other villages on the South side swaying to the beats of the winds.</p>
				<p>From Bogia down to Malala, the beautiful Ulingan Bay is the place where many tourists like to go surfing. As you travel down.</p>
